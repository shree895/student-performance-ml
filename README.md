# 🎓 Student Performance Prediction using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
This project builds an end-to-end machine learning pipeline to predict whether a student will *pass or fail* based on academic performance and personal attributes.

The project demonstrates a complete ML workflow including data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and comparison.
